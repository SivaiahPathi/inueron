    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans. True And False are the two values of the Boolean data type.By using comparision opratiors we write them. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans.And,OR,NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "&\ta & b\tBitwise AND\n",
    "|\ta | b\tBitwise OR\n",
    "^\ta ^ b\tBitwise XOR\n",
    "~\t~a\t    Bitwise NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the values of the following expressions?\n",
    "(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)\n",
    "-False\n",
    "not (5 > 4)\n",
    "-False\n",
    "(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)\n",
    "-True\n",

    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "Ans.=,~=,>,<,>=,<= \n",
    "equal to, not equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans.if we want assign any value we use equal and assignment operators are comparing the two pr more values \n",
    "a=5,b=6,,,a==b is example for assignment operators\n",
    "7. Identify the three blocks in this code:\n",
    "spam = 0\n",
    "if spam == 10:\n",
    "print('eggs')\n",
    "if spam > 5:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "print('ham')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "In this spam =0 in first condition we are checking with spam==0,(but it is not)\n",
    "then spam>5 also not saticefied \n",
    "finally it went for excute else condtion\n",
    "output is \n",
    "    ham\n",
    "    spam\n",

    "8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "spam = 0\n",
    "if spam == 1:   \n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",

    "Ans.CTRL+C\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Ans.Break is used to Break the loop\n",
    "continue is used to skip single iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Ans.Actually There is no difference between three of them given the same output\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "Ans.for i in range(1,11,1):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
