    "\n",
    "2. What does an absolute path start with your operating system?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.An absolute path refers to the complete details needed to locate a file or folder, starting from the root element and ending with the other subdirectories. Absolute paths are used in websites and operating systems for locating files and folders. An absolute path is also known as an absolute pathname or full path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.we use the os. getcwd() method to return the path of the current directory\n",
    "chdir() method in Python used to change the current working directory to specified path\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the . and .. folders?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.The .. shortcut allows you to refer to the parent of a directory with directory/.., its grandparent using directory/../.. and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The . shortcut allows you to explicitly refer to the current directory, in cases where an application requires you to specify a directory (or directories) to search in and you want to search in the current directory\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.C:\\bacon\\eggs  is the dir name spam.txt  is the base name\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.Read Only (‘r’): Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, raises I/O error. This is also the default mode in which the file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write (‘r+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Only (‘w’): Open the file for writing. For existing file, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write and Read (‘w+’): Open the file for reading and writing. For existing file, data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Only (‘a’): Open the file for writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The handle is positioned at the end of the file. The data being written will be inserted at the end, after the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append and Read (‘a+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The handle is positioned at the end of the file. The data being written will be inserted at the end, after the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.If a file with the same name already exists, its contents are discarded and the file is treated as a new empty file\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.The main difference is that read() will read the whole file at once and then print out the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis versus the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.A shelf value resembles a dictionary value; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same names.\n"
