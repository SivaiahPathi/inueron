    "\n",
    "A.You can disable logging messages without removing the logging function calls. You can selectively disable lower-level logging messages. You can create logging messages. Logging messages provides a timestamp.\n",

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.The Step button will move the debugger into a function call. The Over button will quickly execute the function call without stepping into it. The Out button will quickly execute the rest of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in.\n",

    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "A.A breakpoint is a setting on a line of code that causes the debugger to pause when the program execution reaches the line.\n"
